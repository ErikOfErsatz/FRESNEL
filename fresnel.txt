Save file viewer/editor for Eternity Egg. I suck at programming and especially file reading. This is actually my first
time messing with it in any real capacity, and if you're reading this then this is the first thing ive made that's
publicly available. Thank you.

P.S. this will most likely fuck up your save. The first time i added a checkpoint to my save i also got 7 copies of
Pinkbobble. Not sure why. Use your backups. Good luck.
